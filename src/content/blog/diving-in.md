# Lets get this show on the road

Decided once again to rebuild my personal website. This time I'm trying out [Astro](https://astro.build/). I'm not sure if I'm going to like it, but I'm going to give it a try. I'm also going to try to write more blog posts. I'm not sure what I'm going to write about, but I'm sure I'll figure something out.

## First things first

This page is not much, but it is a start. For now it is basically just the astro blog starter. I'm going to change that. I'm going to add some content and make it my own.

Depending on when you read this though it might be different. I have always been fascinated with the idea of learning in the open. Since i love learning and do work in a field where this is very much possible, this site is going to be my playground. It will never be finished. I will publish both half finished and fully fledged posts. I will try to keep the quality up, but I will not let that stop me from publishing. I will implement some kind of flagging system so that you can see what is what.

What do I want to do with this website? I want to have a place where I can write about things I'm interested in. I also want to have a place where I can show off some of my projects.

## What's next?

First thing is to get the site published and live. Working a lot with NextJs in my day to day, hosting stuff on vercel has always been a breeze, so i will first try that as step one. Then of to cloudflare for the other stuff. I assume if this can be read, i will have succeeded.
